# status

vnc viewer only, has limitations with key events and zrle encoding.


# intro

wm/vncv is a vnc viewer.  vnc uses the rfb (remote frame buffer)
protocol.  see the manual page for details, or try:

	wm/vncv hostname


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- support color maps?  only true color (varying depths) is supported now.
- show smaller cursor (mouse pointer) when over vnc fb and drawing local mouse
- use factotum for auth
- fix zrle encoding (may be due to inflate, it needs to flush output before asking new input, the stream never terminates)
- better x11 keysym translation
- get control/shift/alt/function etc keys.  from tk or use a different approach.
- find utf-8/unicode extensions for copy/paste text from/to remote.  it's all latin1 now.
