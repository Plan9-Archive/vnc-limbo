.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Vncv
connects to the remote vnc server at
.IR addr
and shows the remote display locally.
Mouse and key events are sent to the server.  Updates to the display
are received and shown.  Snarf buffers can also be exchanged.
.PP
Options:
.TP
.B -d
Print debugging messages.
.TP
.BI -e " encoding"
Allow use of
.IR encoding
for framebuffer updates.
This option can be specified multiple times.
The following encodings are implemented:
.IR raw ,
.IR copyrect ,
.IR rre ,
.IR hextile ,
.IR localcursor ,
.IR resize .
.I Localcursor
and
.I resize
are pseudo-encodings.
.I Raw
is always implicitly allowed, it causes rectangular updates to be send as uncompressed pixels.
.I Copyrect
updates contain a source and destination rectangle, allowing the local copy of the framebuffer to be updated without transmitting pixels.
.I Rre
and
.I hextile
are more bandwidth-efficient encodings, using run-length encoding and dividing rectangular framebuffer updates into tiles and encoding those.
With
.IR localcursor ,
the vnc server does not send framebuffer updates for mouse movements.
Instead, vncv draws the mouse pointer itself.
The vnc server does send the cursor image when it changes.
With
.IR resize , 
the vnc server send the new resolution when it is changed, instead of disconnecting.
.TP
.BI -p " [l]RGBNNN"
Specify the on-the-wire pixel format to use.
.I RGB
must contain the characters `r', `g' and `b'.  It specifies the order of the color components.
.I NNN
must be three digits between 0 and 8, setting the width of the color components.  The sum of the widths must be either 8, 16 or 24.
The optional leading `l' sets the byte order of the pixel format to little endian.
By default, vncv does not request a pixel format and accepts the format suggested by the server.  
.TP
.BI -w " 8|16|24"
Shortcuts for
.BR -p :
.I 8
for `lbgr233',
.I 16
for `lbgr556' and
.I 24 for `lrgb888'.
.TP
.B -S
Do not ask the vnc server to disconnect other connected clients, i.e. do not disable `shared' mode.
.TP
.B -l
Instead of dialing
.IR addr ,
announce and listen on the address allowing the vnc server to initiate the connection.
The default port for dialing addresses is 5900, the default port for announcing addresses is 5500.
With
.BR -l ,
.I addr
may be absent in which case `*' is used.

.SH BUGS
Vnc authentication uses weak cryptography.
.PP
Tk does not give detailed keyboard events, such as presses and releases of control, alt and shift keys.  Also, not all keyboard characters are translated properly.
.PP
Authentication should be handled by factotum.
.PP
Color maps in the on-the-wire protocol are not yet implemented.
.PP
Only latin-1 text encoding for snarf buffers is supported by the protocol.
